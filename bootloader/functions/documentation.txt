The trashOS bootloader contains a small library of functions that can be called and used from within the main bootloader file, or any other file that is a part of the bootloader. This text document contains a small description of all the functions.

print:
	The "print" function prints a string.
	Note: The string must end with a null byte character, e.g.
	example_string: db 'my_string', 0

	Arguments:
		si: pointer to the string

print_hex:
	The "print_hex" function prints a hex number.
	Note: The maximum number of hex digits supported is four. If a hex number longer than four digits is provided, it will print the last four digits. This function is potentially insecure.

	Arguments:
		dx: containing the value of the hex number to be printed
		
print_nl:
	The "print_nl" function prints a new line.
	
	Arguments:
		No arguments are required for this function

calc_len:
	The "calc_len" function prints the "length", i.e. the number of characters present in a string in hexadecimal; it stores the result in the "cx" register.

	Arguments:
		bx: pointer to the string
		
find_string:
	The "find_string" function searches the memory for a single string that is provided.
	Note: This function only searches the first 64 KiB of memory, from address 0x0000 to 0xffff.
